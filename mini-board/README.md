# MiniBoard

This folder contains a minimalist implementation of the **MiniBoard** project.
It provides a typed Express server with Prisma ORM and shared Zod schemas for
the core models (Board, Group, Item).

## Structure
- `client/` – placeholder for the React application.
- `server/` – Express server with Prisma setup.
- `shared/` – shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas.

The server exposes basic CRUD APIs for boards, groups, and items.
